# @sap/cds-odata-v2-adapter-proxy (cov2ap)

[CDS OData V2 Adapter Proxy](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@sap/cds-odata-v2-adapter-proxy) for [CDS OData V4 Services](https://cap.cloud.sap/docs/)

Based on the [SAP Cloud Application Programming Model (CAP)](https://cap.cloud.sap/docs/)
using CDS Node.js module [@sap/cds](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@sap/cds) or CDS Java modules
[com.sap.cds](https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/com.sap.cds).

## Getting Started

> Only available SAP internally!

- Clone repository
- Unit Tests: `npm test`
- Test Server: `npm start`
  - Service: `http://localhost:4004/v2/main`
  - Metadata: `http://localhost:4004/v2/main/$metadata`
  - Data: `http://localhost:4004/v2/main/Header?$expand=Items`

## Usage

### CDS Combined Backend (CAP Node.js) - Integrated

In your existing `@sap/cds` project:

- Run `npm install @sap/cds-odata-v2-adapter-proxy -s`
- Create new file `server.js` in the service folder `srv` of your project: `./srv/server.js`

```
const cds = require("@sap/cds");
const proxy = require("@sap/cds-odata-v2-adapter-proxy");
cds.on("bootstrap", app => app.use(proxy()));
module.exports = cds.server;
```

- Run `cds run` from the project root to start the server:
  - OData V2 service will be available at http://localhost:4004/v2/<service-path>
  - OData V4 service will be available at http://localhost:4004/<service-path>

Note that `@sap/cds` and `express` are peer dependency and needs to be available as module as well.

### CDS Combined Backend (CAP Node.js) - Custom

In your existing `@sap/cds` project:

- Run `npm install @sap/cds-odata-v2-adapter-proxy -s`
- Create new file `index.js` in the service folder `srv` of your project: `./srv/index.js`

```
const express = require("express");
const cds = require("@sap/cds");
const proxy = require("@sap/cds-odata-v2-adapter-proxy");

const host = "0.0.0.0";
const port = process.env.PORT || 4004;

(async () => {
  const app = express();

  // OData V4
  await cds.connect("db").serve("all").in(app);

  // OData V2
  app.use(proxy());

  const server = app.listen(port, host, () => console.info(`app is listing at ${host}:${port}`));
  server.on("error", error => console.error(error.stack));
})();
```

- Run `node srv/index` from the project root to start the server:
  - OData V2 service will be available at http://localhost:4004/v2/<service-path>
  - OData V4 service will be available at http://localhost:4004/<service-path>

Note that `@sap/cds` and `express` are peer dependency and needs to be available as module as well.

### CDS Standalone Backend (CAP Java or CAP Node.js)

In a new Node.js express project:

- Run `npm install @sap/cds -s`
- Run `npm install @sap/cds-odata-v2-adapter-proxy -s`
- Place CDS models in `db` and `srv` model folders or provide a generated CSN
- Create a new file `index.js` in the service folder `srv` of the project: `./srv/index.js`

```
const express = require("express");
const proxy = require("@sap/cds-odata-v2-adapter-proxy");

const host = "0.0.0.0";
const port = process.env.PORT || 4004;

(async () => {
  const app = express();

  // OData V2
  app.use(proxy({
    target: "<odata-v4-backend-url>", // locally e.g. http://localhost:8080
    services: {
      "<odata-v4-service-path>": "<qualified.ServiceName>"
    }
  }));

  const server = app.listen(port, host, () => console.info(`app is listing at ${host}:${port}`));
  server.on("error", error => console.error(error.stack));
})();
```

- A deployed version of CDS OData V2 Adapter Proxy shall have option `target` set to the deployed OData V4 backend URL.
  This can be retrieved from the Cloud Foundry environment using `process.env`, for example,
  from the `destinations` environment variable. Locally e.g. http://localhost:8080 can be used.
- In proxy option `services`, every OData V4 service URL path needs to mapped to
  the corresponding fully qualified CDS service name, e.g. `"/odata/v4/MainService/": "test.MainService"`,
  to establish the back-link connection between OData URL and its CDS service.
- Make sure, that your CDS models are also available in the project.
  Those reside either in `db` and `srv` folders, or a compiled (untransformed) `srv.json` is provided.
  This can be generated by using the following command:

  ```
  cds srv -s all -o .
  ```

- Alternatively, a `cds build` can be triggered as described in section "Cloud Foundry Deployment".
- If not detected automatically, the model path can be set with option `model` (especially if `csn.json`/`srv.json` option is used).
- Make sure, that all i18n property files reside next to the `csn.json` in a `i18n` or `_i18n` folder, to be detected by localization.
- In a multitenant scenario in combination with a standalone proxy, the CDS model can be retrieved remotely via MTX endpoint (`mtxEndpoint`) by setting proxy option `mtxRemote: true`.
- Proxy option `mtxEndpoint` can be specified as absolute url (starting with `http://` or `https://`), to be able to address MTX Sidecar
  possibly available under a target different from OData v4 backend URL. If not specified absolutely, proxy `target` is prepended to `mtxEndpoint`.

- Run `node srv/index` from the project root to start the server:
  - OData V2 service will be available at http://localhost:4004/v2/<odata-v4-service-path>
  - OData V4 service shall be available at http://localhost:8080/<odata-v4-service-path>

Note that `@sap/cds` and `express` are peer dependency and needs to be available as module as well.

## Cloud Foundry Deployment

When deploying the CDS OData V2 Adapter Proxy to Cloud Foundry, make sure that it has access to the whole CDS model.
Especially, it’s the case, that normally the Node.js server is only based on folder `srv` and folder `db` is then missing on Cloud Foundry.

To come around this situation, trigger a `cds build` during development time, that generates a `csn.json` at location `gen/srv/srv/csn.json`.
Point your Cloud Foundry deployment of the CDS OData V2 Adapter Proxy to the folder `gen/srv` (using manifest.json or MTA), so that
the CDS models can be found via file `srv/csn.json`, during runtime execution on Cloud Foundry.

Make sure, that all i18n property files reside next to the `csn.json` in a `i18n` or `_i18n` folder, to be detected by localization.

## SAP Fiori Elements V2

The OData V2 service provided by the CDS OData V2 Adapter Proxy can be used to serve an SAP Fiori Elements V2 UI.
