#### Added
- Initial Version
- Consolidated the existing `Fiori elements` and `Fiori freestyle` generators into one. The first step of the combined generator will ask you to choose which type of application you would like to generate.
- Added support for deployment configuration as part of generation. Users can now choose to add either Cloud Foundry or ABAP deployment configuration using the generator if they wish.
- Added support for Fiori launch pad (FLP) configuration as part of generation.  
- Added a new `Cloud Foundry Application Router Generator` that allows the user to generate generic Cloud Foundry configuration which can then be used with subsequent Fiori projects.
- Added support for custom paths for folder locations in CDS projects.
- The authenticated username is now displayed alongside the saved system name when using VSCode.
